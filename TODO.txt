TO DO
Think ok a cool name for the project, call it something like a cat.. eg dabbles 
Maybe a competition ;-)

=========
Browser Widget

The browser widget needs to be fully function with url, back forward, search to google, arduino etc

It will manifest itself in the application in three ways
 * static local pages wuch as Welcome pages, and other "Application" info- maybe even some qt/webkit objecct sharing
 * Browsing the static html and the links to arduin - u dont know where your at, as local html help is "lift" of online
 * Links to browse/search the newsgroup, forums, playgound
