Browser Widget
---------------
* Add a "full" view browser and a "compact" view. 
  - Add JS API to toggle mode
* Add a "Quick Links" block to the welcome page
  - Should we use the Websites listing? 
  - Add JS API to grab quick links

## I want to have a whole bookmarks system for link relevant
there are the standard places, and then specific bookmarks
per session..
Also a simple editor to "maintain" bookmarks..

The inbuilt browser need to be "clean" and specific to the task at hand.

Autosave
--------
We need to add an autosave function. Maybe use a QTimer to periodically save?
* Add Autosave
* Add crash handler
* Add recovery wizard

Icons and Style
---------------------------
We Need a graphic designer to create the style, inspiration is #color, however in Qt its QtGui.QColor(125,12,3)
Its a bit of a mix and match application in the following. The issue is the "stle sheet"
* the inernal browser uses native html, and style sheet
* Qt widgets also use a setStyleSheet() but it has problems, eg setting a border on a wodget, will also set borders all all the kids
* tree's need to be set as an object. eg QtGui.QColor(125,12,3) ie not sing with "css"
* You can style a treeWidget, instead u need a delegate ?? umm


Events and Handlers
-----------------------------------------------------
* .Central event handler maybe - OSx style
